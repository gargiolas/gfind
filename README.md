# gfind

The purpose of this library is to simplify the process of scanning assemblies for types (classes or implementations) of particular interfaces and registering those types into a dependency injection container managed by Microsoft's `IServiceCollection`.

This library simplifies **dependency injection registration** by:
1. Scanning assemblies to find classes implementing specific interfaces (`TClass`).
2. Allowing specific lifetimes (`Scoped`, `Transient`, or `Singleton`) for the registration.
3. Automating the process and reducing boilerplate code.
4. Supporting extensibility by allowing multiple assemblies to be scanned.

Itâ€™s especially useful in scenarios where there are many services implementing multiple interfaces, and you want a scalable, centralized way to handle DI registration.

Example

     services.RegisterScopedServices<IRandomService>(assemblies);
